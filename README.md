Following is a description of the elements included in this project so
far, along with descriptions of their options and settings.

    - The "Rounded Corners" option available in the context menu makes
      the corners rounded (default), or straight. This is to simulate
      the static/fixed and non-static/fixed navbars.

      the default Navbar look.

      font of the brand label in the Navbar.
